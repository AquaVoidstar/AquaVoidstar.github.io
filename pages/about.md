![Pic of me](/assets/img/avatars/ProfilePic.png)

Currently a Physics and Mathematics double major at Virginia Tech. I mostly started this blog as       
a personal challenge to myself as it takes me very far outside of my area of expertise but I do find   
the process fairly enjoyable. My goal with this blog is to improve my abilities in terms of critical 
thinking and computer science skills especially computational physics which has been the bulk 
of my undergraduate research. I hope to be able to talk about a wide variety of subjects but it
should be noted that I am not an expert in any particular field.

I am still fairly new to this whole blogging venture and it is partially motivated by 
the 2020 Caronavirus outbreak that forced countries to issue Stay-At-Home orders. 
This took me out of my normal school environment and simultaneously gave me a lot of 
free time and not much else outside of my normal academic obligations.
### Below is a link to my resume; I will try and update it routinely:
