![Pic of me](/assets/img/avatars/ProfilePic.png)

My name is Mason and I use the pronouns He/Him. I graduated from Virginia Tech in the Fall of 2020 with a double major in Physics and Mathematics. I am interested in a variety of things but have a deep passion for physical phenomenon and computational modeling. I mostly started this blog as a personal challenge to myself as it takes me very far outside of my area of expertise as I perviously was only interested in scientific applications for computing but I am hoping to expand my knowledge base and am always looking for new challenges. My goal with this blog is to improve my abilities in terms of critical 
thinking and computer science skills especially computational physics which has been the bulk 
of my undergraduate research. I hope to be able to talk about a wide variety of subjects but most of my posts will be somewhat technical in nature.

I am still fairly new to this whole blogging venture and it is partially motivated by 
the 2019-??? Caronavirus outbreak that forced countries to issue Stay-At-Home orders. 
This took me out of my normal school environment and simultaneously gave me a lot of 
free time and not much else outside of my normal academic obligations.
### Below is a link to my resume. I will try and update it routinely:
