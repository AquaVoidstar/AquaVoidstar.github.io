# Hello and welcome to my personal website. 
I honestly do not have much to say here. I think the intension is fairly obvious and I just want to highlight that the current architecture of the website is Type on Strap which I found was a good enough starting point. This is also using Jekyll as I just wanted something lightweight but with flexibility if I wanted to change things later.
